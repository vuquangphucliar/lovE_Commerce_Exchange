# LovE_Commerce_Exchange
Hi, Welcome to my project LovE-Commerce Exchange


First of all, let's talk about how I started on this project.
This is just kind of a big exercise I was assigned for my desktop programming lecture at my school.
I was getting started on this project on 11/11/2023 and almost finished it over one month later.
That's some information about this project, and obviously I did it by myself.


Installation :
1. Make sure that you have SQL Server 2022 (I'm working on this version when I build the project).
2. And you need to have Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, and that's all we need to run this project.


Setup:
1. Clone this repository and download the backup database file of this app to your computer.
2. Restore that database on your server (I assume that you know how to restore a database using file.bak as well).
3. Configure the connection string in my project in the Myconnection.cs file. Just replace the string with the correct server name, and everything will run automatically. If you get an error, just fix it yourself. I had covered most of problem related to file location because it belongs to my local, not yours, so if I miss any of them, fix it for me.
4. After you have done all of these things I said, now I assume that it'll run successfully, and one more thing I need to
say that because the backup file is a local database, all the links in the database're useless to you, so you need to change All of those location links are mostly the image links manually in this app.
